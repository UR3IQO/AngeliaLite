/*************************************************************************

	The sidetone is generated using an 256 value sine wave ROM look-up table
	(sine_256.mif) and a Direct Digital Synthesiser. 

	DDS description
	
	The DDS works by adding a constant value to an accumulator and using the overlow 
	as the address of a sine table.  The constant is determined from the frequency 
	required to be generated as follows:
	
		constant = Fout * (sine table size) * (accumulator size) / Fpwm
		
		hence for 600Hz, a 256 entry sine table, 2^16 accumalator and 48ksps
		
		constant = 600 * 256 * 2^16 /48000 = 209,715
		
	In order to calculate the constant for the required frequency use
		
		constant = Fout * 256 * 2^16 /48000 = Fout * 350

		+--------------------------------------+
		|				24 bit constant				|

		 Add constant to Accumulator at PWM rate

	The amplitude of the sine wave is set by multiplying the samples by the 
	sidetone_level.  Finaly a raised cosine profile is applied to the leading
	and trailing edges of the sine wave. The tone is produced whilst CW_PTT is
	active and enable is set.
