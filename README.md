The goal of this project was to build an OpenHPSDR compatible SDR transceiver based on the SDR module I have already designed earlier for other project. The FPGA firmware is base on the OpenHPSDR Angelia code, the NCO code is from the HermesLite2 project. There were many changes in the code to fit 4 DDCs into the small EP4CE22E22 FPGA.
